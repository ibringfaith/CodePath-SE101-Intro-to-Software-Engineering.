# CodePath-SE101-Intro-to-Software-Engineering.
This is some of my coursework for the CodePath course I completed over the Summer of 2023. This course is taught primarily in Python programming language and focuses on introductory topics from conditionals, loops, big O notation, hashmaps, strings, arrays, and recursion.
